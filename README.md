**Installations:**\
You only need a server to host the website files and database to connect to it.

One possible example is to use a program like AppServ or XAMPP.

**For AppServ:** paste the project inside the "www" folder inside the program directory.\
**For XAMPP:** paste the project inside the "htdocs" folder inside the program directory.

The database connection is established the same way in both programs by setting the username and password for the database during the installation process.
